# Reusability Without Compromise

Reusability is a matter of many compromises. Should complexity live in one place or many? What is the optimal balance between easier development, faster velocity, and manageable test setup? We’ll talk about the tools we use to make our components faster to develop and to share. We’ll share the approach we take to achieve the perfect balance of dumb and smart components. Finally, we’ll discuss the performance considerations that shaped our current solution.
